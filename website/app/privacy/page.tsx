                an organization’s mailing list to that organization; we can help
                identify the right route. A separately self-hosted installation
                is controlled by its operator, who must provide their own
                privacy notice and retention policy. Merely running the

                Ordinary Google sign-in and permission to access Gmail are
                separate choices. The Google mail feature is in limited testing.
                Connecting a mailbox authorizes Xem’s backend to access the
                selected Gmail or Google Workspace account to display folders,
                search and read messages and attachments, change read and star
                flags, and send messages and replies you request. The connected
                sender can also be used in workflows you configure, subject to
                Google’s limits and anti-spam requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current test connector uses Google’s full-mailbox permission
                for IMAP and SMTP. This permission is broader than the
                operations currently offered. It is under review before public
                availability. It does not provide access to Drive files,
                calendars, or all accounts in your Google Workspace domain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Incoming mail is fetched on demand; the connector does not
                maintain a complete local mirror of the inbox. The backend
                stores the mailbox address, configuration references and
                encrypted authorization credentials. Outgoing message records
                can contain subject, body, recipients, attachments and delivery
                information. Opening mail also sends the requested content to
                your browser.

                Our proposed commitments require service providers to use data
                only to supply the requested service under appropriate
                restrictions. We do not sell Google user data or use it for
                advertising, data brokerage, credit decisions, or unrelated
                profiling. We may disclose data when legally required or
                necessary to investigate abuse or a security incident, limited
                to that purpose. Any transfer of Google data as part of a
                business sale requires prior user consent where Google’s policy
                requires it.

                consent to specific support access, necessary security work,
                legally required access, or permitted anonymized and aggregated
                internal operations. Support access is not permission to browse

                by workspace tools. Those results can include outgoing email
                data. Google-derived text may be included if you ask AI to work
                with a reply or other email content. Connecting Gmail by itself

                Our proposed policy prohibits using Google user data to train or
                improve general-purpose AI models. Hosted AI providers, their
                retention periods and their contractual data-use terms must be
                confirmed and disclosed before this policy becomes effective or
                Google data is enabled for hosted AI processing. Those checks
                are not complete; the name of a model is not evidence of its
                provider’s data handling.

                You can read, compose and send messages without using AI. Review

                  Backup copies are isolated from normal product use, and
